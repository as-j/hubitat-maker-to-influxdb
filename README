* A Bridge from Hubitat Maker API to InfluxDB

This is very alpha, and there's many places it may crash.  Running from pm2 so it can loop and restart is important for now.

How to Use:

1. On the Hubitat install a new instance of the MakerAPI
1. Select devices you want to log data from. Ex:
  1. Motion Sensors that send temperature data
  1. Power or energy use sensors
1. Create a config.json described below for each hub
1. Install influxdb locally and bind it to 127.0.0.1, don't turn on auth
1. Run hubitat-maker-to-influxdb

Place a config file in: ~/.hubitat-maker-to-influxdb/config.json

An example is:

```
{
    "local_config" : {
    },
    "hubs" : {
        "homeTester": {
            "url": "http://<hub-ip>/apps/api/<maker-app-number>",
            "token":  "<ACCESS_TOKEN>",
            "influxdb_db_name": "HubitatTester"
        },
        "home": {
            "url": "http://192.168.7.97/apps/api/769",
            "token": "abcd-12345-etc",
            "locationName": "Home",
            "locationId": "0",
            "hubId": "0"
        }
    }
}
```
